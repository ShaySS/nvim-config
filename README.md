# README
This folder is the remote origin for my config repository
The zshrc_lazygit folder contains config for my nvim, and a copy of my .zshrc

Run the script inside "zshrc_lazygit" to make a copy of my .zshrc here

Current issues with my vim config:

- All lsp errors are prefaced with 'typescript' for some reason
- I wasn't seeing the warning that I usually see in VSCode for images needing an alt tag
